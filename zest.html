    <div class="overview"> <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="overviewstyle"> This app is intended for users to save and organize recipes created by the user or saved from another source. Users would be able to add ingredients, instructions, footnotes, organize with keywords, search with keywords such as ingredients or meal type, send to other users or to contacts, add to pinterest, and rate recipes. This app is intended to be a personal and shareable recipe database.

    <h3>Problem & Solution</h3>
    <p>With an overwhelming amount of resources available for your average cook, there is a need for a better way to organize and access our most favorite recipes. Cookbooks, magazines, online blogs, social media platforms  and food websites all carry precious gems that we discovered from inspiration, planning a feast, or simply because we have a specific craving. Zest allows users to organize and share recipes (from whatever medium or original) from cookbooks they have created and saved on the application.
<br>
<br>
    With further research and testing we uncovered more features that make Zest the perfect kitchen tool.
    Process
    In order to successfully solve the problem on how to manage and organize a users’ beloved recipes, we had to ask the people. During this process we discovered what other problems the average cook has outside of recipe organization and how to avoid or solve those problems with Zest.</p>

           <h3>User Research/Survey</h3>
     <div class="researchstyle">
<p>The results of the deployed survey, showed that the majority of surveyors cook 3-5 times per week (60%) and all spend the most time cooking dinner. 73.3% meal prep for the week and 75% of surveyors have leftover ingredients - a feature that allows users to easily find recipes that could be used with leftovers would be successful. Because a large majority meal-preps a way to organize these recipes specifically as well as a feature to create shopping lists would be strongly beneficial. The top 3 sources of recipes are from online (87.5%), cookbooks (62.5%), and given by family and friends (50%). Results also show that 50% of surveyors share recipes through email or text, followed by Pinterest and Instagram (both 12.5% respectively). Because most recipes are found online and cookbooks it would be a great feature to be able to organize favored recipes from these mediums into one platform for easy accessibility. Online recipes are saved by copying and pasting the recipe or link and then stored on their phone (50%) or printed and saved as a hard copy. 62.5% of surveyors find it hard to keep track of their favored recipes. Since surveyors share their recipes in this way it would be also functional for such users to send and share recipes easier - preferably on the same platform for easier organization. For surveyors that don’t cook - 40% don’t have the time and 20% admit that they are simply not good at cooking. 70% of these surveyors dine out 3-5 times a week. 100% get meals delivered 1-2 a week. With these results, it might be useful to cater to beginner cooks as well - the shopping list feature would be useful to save time and plan ahead, organizing recipes by level of difficulty could also be helpful.

    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>he competitive analysis conducted compared three food apps that stored recipes: Big Oven, Epicurious, and Side Chef. Of all three, Epicurious seemed like our biggest competition based on the following and the company’s association with Conde Nast and Bon Appetite. However their app did have it’s weaknesses that we felt Zest could alleviate. Side Chef brands itself as a “cooking assistant” for beginner cooks with its guided cooking features, though the recipes are not properly vetted and as a result the reviews were quite poor. This was a great opportunity for Zest. Why not have access to your own personal network of users who’s recipe you can trust?</p>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="personas"> <h1>User Personas</h1>
    <p>Our user personas reflected the frustrations among our surveyors and reviewers of the apps we analyzed in our competitive analysis. Max likes to stay fit and healthy so he seeks to find a better way to organize his meal plans during the week. He prefers to do his grocery shopping and meal prep on Sundays and gets his meal inspiration from his social media accounts and health-centered food blogs. Since he hasn’t made a collection of the recipes he’s tried, he usually toggles between the same 4-5 recipes he knows off-hand. Cassandra is a mother of 2 who works from home. Since she is not far from her kitchen, she has time to be adventurous with her family meals. Since he has a picky toddler, she often shares recipes among other mothers at her child’s daycare. Leftover ingredients that need to repurposed and a collection of recipes printed from online resources and saved on her devices are Cassandra’s main frustrations.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <div class="userflows"><h1>User Flows</h1>
     <p>Because our results so far indicate the surveyors have no clear way of saving, organizing, or sharing their recipes it was important to create user flows that make this a simple process for our users. The competitive analysis of Side Chef, Big Oven, and Epicurious presented a number of weaknesses that can be used to elevate the features of the Zest app. As we created the user flows from our high-priority tasks, the app began to take shape.

      <h1>Wireframes & Mockups, Prototypes (with iterations)</h1>
      <p>This phase was crucial to the development and success of the application. Once in hand it would be up to the tester to determine what works and what doesn’t work. From the skeletal version (wireframes) to the mockups, changes were made as we moved from one screen to the next. As the color story was applied, sizing of images, CTA buttons added, Zest began to take its shape. Moving forward, some very important questions were asked, and thus very important solutions also were in order.</p>

      <a id="branding"></a>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="branding"><h1>Branding</h1>
    <p>Developing the branding for Zest was challenging at first, researching food-related brands, icons - it was hard to find a direction. Mind-mapping a list of cooking techniques, food words and then really deciding which word properly represented this app. Zest was ultimately chosen for its simplicity and for aesthetics. Sketches of the logo were then created and tested, the citrus logo ultimately received the most positive responses. The Style Guide showcases the fonts chosen for Zest and what each font will be used for, as well as the color palette, CTA buttons, and logo options.</p>

      <a id="testing"></a>
    <section class="section">
      <div class="testing"> <h1>User Testing</h1>
    <p>From the tests conducted the overall response was positive. However there were a few notes made on the usability, specifically the importance of having an introduction of the features within Zest. I noticed without this the users spent more time looking through the icons when asked to perform a specific task. When asked if any features should be added or taken away, two users suggests a privacy option for recipes and cookbooks. Another user suggested adding “prep-time” and “cook time” options as well. A question arose on whether keywords were hashtags and upon considering options, it would be a good idea to add this to the filter. Since typing “#item” would be up to the user, there wouldn’t need to be a visual element added. I found the suggestion to add the recipe title to the ingredient added to the shopping list to be useful. Which then gave me the idea to consolidate ingredient items when added from recipes.</p>

  <div class="conclusionstyle"> During the production of Zest we discovered that alleviating the weaknesses of our competition was not an easy task. We found that problems arose during the prototype phase, successful usability being the ultimate goal. Some features had some aesthetic challenges when following best practices for mobile. During the usability tests we learned of new features we should add, such as a privacy option. As we moved along in the process, some valuable questions were asked, the most important questions being “Is this necessary?” which then lead to “What am I trying to solve?” and “Am I creating a problem?”. Ultimately I would say restraint was a key skill that was practiced. Making sure every function was exactly what it should be and nothing more.
