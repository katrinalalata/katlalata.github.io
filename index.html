  <h1>about: katrina lalata</h1>
  <p>I worked as an Early Childhood Educator in Toronto, making my way teaching
through various age groups. The most challenging being toddlers. Designing
experiences that allow children to thrive  was crucial to the success of my daily
routine.Offering activities that are too advanced and open ended runs the risk of
 disaster - paint everywhere, sparkles everywhere. This inherently practiced my
skill of strategy, creativity, and surprisingly - restraint. As a UX Designer and
strategist I hope to influence the educational sector. I have worked with children
 for years as an educator in Toronto and Berlin and want to extend my pedagogical
and developmental craft to create meaningful interactive experiences for children.</p>
