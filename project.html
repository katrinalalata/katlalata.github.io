          <p><b><i>Projects</b></i> was created to enhance your productivity by accessing your most used cloud storage apps on one platform. This accessibility allows Pinterest, Evernote, and Google Drive users to seamlessly toggle between these applications conveniently while organizing data in one safe and secure place. Projects has included features such Groups which allows you to share and update files with multiple users much like a group chat. With real-time notifications across synced devices, users won’t skip a beat.
          <br>I was responsible in the discovery, strategy, information architecture, visual design and development. Google Forms was used to conduct and track the survey process, as well as Figma for the prototypes, branding and style guides.</p></br>

          <a id="problem"></a><h2>problem & solution</h2>
          <p>The client wanted to make an impression in the cloud storage arena. Because the cloud storage industry is fairly new, our client was excited at the possibilities and opportunities this could bring. Not having a concise plan or structure given, they did have a few expected features for this app:
          <ul class="a">
          <li>saving content you find on the web (links, images, videos, etc.)</li>
          <li>organizing that content using things like categories, tags, groups, and/or folders</li>
          <li>creating content (notes, documents, maybe spreadsheets?)</li>
          <li>uploading files (videos, images, PDFs, etc.) from a computer or mobile device</li>
          <li>sharing a single item with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
          <li>sharing a folder or group of items with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
          <li>connecting with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents</li></ul>
          <p>In order to satisfy our client’s needs we began looking at our cloud storage competition and analyzing the strengths and opportunities, essentially we wanted to see where we could fit in and where this app could thrive. Here we discovered the issue was not to create a new app for the masses, but to offer a more efficient way for our users to organize and manage their data.
          Instead of toggling between your most used sharing apps why not use one platform effortlessly?</p></div>

          <a id="process"></a><section class="part">
          <h2>process</h2>
          <p>In order to execute the outline of expected features given, we need to look at our core demographic - you. We wanted to create an app that could be used by anyone. If you wanted to plan and share the menu for the next family holiday dinner or have an important client brief that needs to be seen by several sets of eyes - we wanted Projects to get you through it.
          <br>How do we get there? We asked the people.</br></p>

          <a id="survey"></a><section class="part">
          <h2>survey</h2>
          <div class="survey"><div class="scale-in"><img src="images/survey.jpg" srcset="images/survey.jpg 1x, images/survey.jpg 2x"></div></div>
          <p>In this survey we asked various questions such as “what cloud storage apps do you use?”, “what device do you mostly use your cloud storage app on?”, and “what, if any, frustrates you about cloud storage apps?”. Such questions helped us itemize the features held most valuable by the user. From the results of the survey, we have gathered that there was an even split between users who use cloud storage on their mobile devices and laptop/desktop. With this, we thought to deliver an app that can be easily and seamlessly accessible from both devices, at all times, anywhere.

          <div class="image-wrapper"><img src="images/competitiveanalysis.jpg" srcset="images/competitiveanalysis.jpg 1x, images/competitiveanalysis.jpg 2x"></div>
          <p>Once I gathered data from our surveyors it was time to compare our competition. We looked at Pinterest, Google Docs, and Evernote.

          <br>We see why users are devoted to all three apps, we love them too. Pinterest allows you to save pins and build boards and share them. Evernote lets you save and share and organize all your notes. And Google Docs has served as a reliable tool that just gets better and better with time. Oh, and not to mention - it’s free.</br>

          <br>This is where Projects was conceived. Once I got rolling with the user flows for these three apps, I realized how simple and second nature it is for these users to save and share content within these applications (as is with most things done habitually), that maybe  the creation of a brand new cloud storage app wasn’t most necessary. All that’s needed to be done is make using all three easier. With some perks.</br>

          <p>Our user personas are based on individuals who would utilize this app for leisure as well as professionally. Geneva is newly engaged and is looking to share her ideas with her bridesmaids, Pinterest being her app of choice is creating her boards and search for inspiration and ideas. Her frustrations primarily involve limited accessibility on her commute and inability to share with non-Pinterest users. Robert uses his cloud storage apps mostly professionally, collaborating with other designers. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R41Xl9PZWAFkdqVGHKOm5R8KcnotajXQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>Robert</b></a> uses all three apps we analyzed for competitive analysis - Google Docs (for contracts and documents), Evernote and Pinterest (for inspiration and notes). Roberts frustrations are limited storage space and accessibility is limited to internet connection. Both users are looking to keep inspiration and creativity momentum as well as sharing and collaborating seamlessly between devices.</p>

          <p>Take a closer look at the user flows <!-- here -->
          <br>Here we created user flows to analyze our competition, or rather, see how they became so successful and what is holding them back. In this process we compiled <!-- user stories,  sketches, --> and user flows (left).</br>
          <br>From the data we collected we decided we wanted to allow access to these apps within Projects. We wanted to bring a sense of familiarity to our users, after all, the majority of our surveyors are avid users of all three services. </br>
          <br>As we move forward in structuring the paths of Projects, we decided to keep gestures and flows simple and direct. Saving items, adding images or content, accessing files and collaboration and sharing is done in the same fashion as the other applications.</br></p>

          <p>This phase was crucial to the development and success of the application. Some very important questions were asked, and thus very important solutions also were in order. Although the prototypes were skeletal versions of the actual app it was important to see how the app itself would be handled which is crucial to its day-to-day success.</p>

          <br><i>Refinements, Boards, Style Guides</i></br>
          <br>Probably the most fun thing to do is compare typefaces. Finding a perfect match was tricky but nothing compares to how satisfying it is to begin building the app’s physical character.</br></p>

          <p>In this phase I did two rounds of designs with a preference test. The more I got to using the app the better acquainted I became with design - I started stripping certain aspects we simply found visually unnecessary. It was important (and a challenge) to not add clutter to a productivity app to maximize its potential. </p>

          <p>The first design mock-up and the final

          <br>After several rounds of testing I became more aware of the changes I needed to make along the way. Although the overall reviews were positive, there were definitely some design adjusts and suggestions worth exploring. I found that the design and aesthetics of this app was where I had the most struggles, but also the most satisfaction. It was nice to practice sound judgement and decision making when coming to face what works and what doesn’t. It was such a journey, looking back at how different the initial phases to the becoming of what Projects is now. If more time were given I would spend more time researching and testing animation development for the app. </p></br>
